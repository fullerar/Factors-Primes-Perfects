# Factors-Primes-Perfects
Some simple Haskell functions that can be used to calculate various factors, primes, and perfect numbers.

Functions:

- factors n      => generates a list of all factors of n
- isPrime n      => returns true iff n is a prime
- primeFactors n => generates a list of all prime factors of n
- primesUpTo n   => generates a list of all primes up to n
- isPerfect n    => returns true iff n is a perfect number
- perfectUpTo n  => generates a list of all perfect numbers up to n
- nextPrime n    => generates the next prime greater than n
- generatePrimes => generates the first n primes
